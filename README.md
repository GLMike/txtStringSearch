## Text Document String Search

** *Disclaimer: Personal project, utilized in very niche circumstances. Program may not suit the average person's needs.* **

The program is designed to accept a string from the user and search a folder containing subfolders for the containing string.
Once the containing string is found, the program displays all results in a table format, and then offers
the user the option to copy the line in the text document containing the result to a new *combined* document. 

*This program only searches text documents*
